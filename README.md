P5â€“ Online delivery system: The community center in our campus is slightly far for a walk and do
shopping especially in Jodhpur Summer. We wish to develop an online delivery system. All students
and faculty family member are potential customers of this system. The idea is to perform online search
of products, and able to perform online shopping. System should support cash on delivery and also
support credit option. There should also be a provision to choose preferred delivery slot.
