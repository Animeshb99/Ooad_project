P5â€“ Online delivery system: The community center in our campus is slightly far for a walk and do
shopping especially in Jodhpur Summer. We wish to develop an online delivery system. All students
and faculty family member are potential customers of this system. The idea is to perform online search
of products, and able to perform online shopping. System should support cash on delivery and also
support credit option. There should also be a provision to choose preferred delivery slot.

This project was developed as a course project for Dr. Anand Mishra, instructor, Object Oriented Analysis and Design Course. This project encouraged us to expand our horizon on understanding and applying object oriented analysis and design in real life applications. 
## Problem Statement
The Community Centre of IIT Jodhpur is far for a walk from the student hostels and faculty residence. This makes it very difficult to go and shop for daily needs especially in the scorching heat of Rajasthan. 
An online delivery system needs to be developed. The potential customers of this delivery system are the students and faculty members. There has to be online search of products and the customer should be able to perform online shopping. There will be various options available to the customers for completing the payment- cash on delivery(CoD), money wallet(CCwallet) or credit system. The customers can choose their delivery location and delivery slot as per their convenience.
